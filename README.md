# CatalystRPC
Discord Rich Presence integration for Mirror's Edge Catalyst.

## Installation
Simply download the .zip file from [the releases page](https://github.com/RubberDuckShobe/CatalystRPC/releases) and extract its contents into the same folder as the game executable.

## How to build
To build CatalystRPC, you'll need Visual Studio 2019 and [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

Once you have those set up, all that's left to do is install the discord-game-sdk package with ``vcpkg discord-game-sdk:x64-windows`` and you're ready to go!
